# Community (community)

An Instagram clone using Quasar framework.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).

## Roadmap

### Initializing the Quasar project
```bash
npm init quasar
```

### Folder and Files Structure

- The main folder we are concerned with is the `src` folder. This contains an `App.vue` file.
- `App.vue` is the **main** Vue component. Within this `<router-view />` directs points us to the `layouts` folder.
- The `MainLayout.vue` is the base layout of our app (generated by default). Within **layouts** we load **pages**.
- The `<q-page-container>` within MainLayout.vue specifies the location where our pages will be loaded.
- `assets` folder contains any images etc. *Anything we put in this folder will be processed by **Webpack**. This means that images might get converted to **base64** and stuff like that*
- `boot` folder is used to store the boot files. **Boot** file allows us to initialize code before the app starts. This is really good for initializing *plugins* and stuff like that.
- `components` folder to keep any Vue components.
- `css/quasar.variables.sass` has some CSS variables defined which we can change to customise our app.
- `router` folder, where qwqe configure the routes of our app.
- `postcss.config.js` is used to add assets. Assets added here will not be processed by webpack (cross-check to ensure this point).

## Changed the <script></script> tag in MainLayout.vue
original lines
```javascript
export default defineComponent({
  name: 'MainLayout',
  components: {
    ...
  },
  setup () {
    const leftDrawerOpen = ref(false)
    return {

      ...

    }
  }
})
```

New lines
```javascript
export default {
  name: 'MainLayout',
  data () {
    return {
    }
  }
}
```

## Formating how the "Date" is displayed in Quasar

Quasar has in-built utility to help with the same. Click [here](https://quasar.dev/quasar-utils/date-utils#introduction) for more info.

## [Classes “q-col-gutter-{size}”](https://quasar.dev/layout/grid/gutter#classes-q-col-gutter-size)

These classes are to be used when the direct children have col-* or offset-* classes that specify a width.

## Generating "Unique Id" for object inside data() function

Quasar has in built Utility to generate Id. See [here](https://quasar.dev/quasar-utils/other-utils#uid-generate-uid).

## Accessing Camera maybe not supported in every browser
Check the Mozilla docs for **Browser Compactibility** [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia#browser_compatibility). Some older versions of different browsers use different function name for `getUserMedia`. To help solve this issue, we use a npm package `md-gum-polyfill`.

```bash
// md-gum-polyfill => mediaDevices-getUserMedia-polyfill
npm install --save md-gum-polyfill
```
See [here](https://github.com/mozdevs/mediaDevices-getUserMedia-polyfill#readme) to see usage of `md-gum-polyfill`.

## Fallback for when user "denies" camera access etc.

- In this case, we have implemented a file-picker `<q-file>` and saved the selected file inside `imageUpload` data variable.
- Now we need to show a thumbnail inside the camera-frame for the selected image by creating a *blob*.
- To show a thumbanail of the image file selected by user, check the *Upload Image to Canvas* in Reference section.

## Interesting

- `toDataURL()` is used to convert to image to base64 string. See `CameraPage: line 88`.
- `blob` Binary log object. We use this to create image from a base64 string/URL. See `CameraPage: line 90`. Check *Converting Data URI to Blob* in Reference section.
- We use **Arrow functions** so that we can still use our *Vue* instance with the **"this"** keyword. See `CameraPage: line 107, 121`.
- `getVideoTracks()` returns all of the tracks used by this "video" element. See `CameraPage: line 125`.
- `beforeDestroy()` hook is triggered just before we leave a page. Hence this is used to *disable" camera when user leaves the camera page. See `CameraPage: line 159`.
