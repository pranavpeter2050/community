# Community (community)

An Instagram clone using Quasar framework.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).

## Roadmap

### Initializing the Quasar project
```bash
npm init quasar
```

### Folder and Files Structure

- The main folder we are concerned with is the `src` folder. This contains an `App.vue` file.
- `App.vue` is the **main** Vue component. Within this `<router-view />` directs points us to the `layouts` folder.
- The `MainLayout.vue` is the base layout of our app (generated by default). Within **layouts** we load **pages**.
- The `<q-page-container>` within MainLayout.vue specifies the location where our pages will be loaded.
- `assets` folder contains any images etc. *Anything we put in this folder will be processed by **Webpack**. This means that images might get converted to **base64** and stuff like that*
- `boot` folder is used to store the boot files. **Boot** file allows us to initialize code before the app starts. This is really good for initializing *plugins* and stuff like that.
- `components` folder to keep any Vue components.
- `css/quasar.variables.sass` has some CSS variables defined which we can change to customise our app.
- `router` folder, where qwqe configure the routes of our app.
- `postcss.config.js` is used to add assets. Assets added here will not be processed by webpack (cross-check to ensure this point).

## Changed the <script></script> tag in MainLayout.vue
original lines

export default defineComponent({
  name: 'MainLayout',
  components: {
    ...
  },
  setup () {
    const leftDrawerOpen = ref(false)
    return {

      ...

    }
